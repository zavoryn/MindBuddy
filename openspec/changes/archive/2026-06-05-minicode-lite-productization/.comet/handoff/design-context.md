## Why

`mindbuddy` now has a strong runtime kernel, session replay, and checkpoint/rewind
surfaces, but it still feels like an advanced local runtime rather than a
lightweight Claude Code-style product. The next step is to turn the current
kernel into a coherent product surface by finishing the missing P1-P3 layers:
instruction governance, first-class delegation, extensibility, and release-grade
operator ergonomics.

## What Changes

- Add explicit instruction and policy layers so users can inspect which global,
  user, project, and machine-managed guidance was active in a turn.
- Turn hooks into first-class workflows with inspectable registration, lifecycle,
  async execution outcomes, and operator-facing UX in CLI/TUI/session artifacts.
- Productize delegated/background execution so subagents and long-running helper
  tasks are bounded, inspectable, replayable, and recoverable.
- Introduce a lightweight extension packaging model for local plugins/skills so
  `mindbuddy` can share reusable commands and workflows without needing a heavy
  marketplace.
- Expand runtime evaluation and operator diagnostics into a release-readiness
  surface that can compare profiles, validate provider fallback behavior, and
  explain degraded states clearly.

## Capabilities

### New Capabilities

- `instruction-policy-layers`: Explicit instruction precedence, inspection, and
  managed policy loading for runtime turns and session artifacts.
- `first-class-hook-workflows`: Hook registration, visibility, async completion,
  and operator workflows that feel like a product surface instead of an internal
  API.
- `delegated-background-runtime`: Product-grade background and subagent
  execution with inspectable status, isolated outputs, and replayable summaries.
- `extension-packaging`: Lightweight local plugin/skill packaging, discovery,
  enablement, and shareable install flows.
- `product-readiness-evaluation`: Release-facing evaluation, provider-fallback
  diagnostics, and runtime health reporting that make `mindbuddy-lite` operable.

### Modified Capabilities

- None.

## Context

`mindbuddy` has already closed most of the original P0 gap against a lightweight
Claude Code experience: runtime phases are explicit, widening and verification
are typed, sessions are persistent, and edits are recoverable through
checkpoint/rewind. The remaining gap is now product-surface coherence rather than
core loop invention.

The current codebase already contains the right primitives:

- instruction loading and prompt assembly:
  - `mindbuddy/prompt.py`
  - `mindbuddy/prompt_pipeline.py`
- settings and provider runtime validation:
  - `mindbuddy/config.py`
- hook lifecycle and script execution:
  - `mindbuddy/hooks.py`
- background task tracking:
  - `mindbuddy/background_tasks.py`
- runtime control, events, and fallback behavior:
  - `mindbuddy/agent_loop.py`
- session inspection, replay, checkpoints, and rewind:
  - `mindbuddy/session.py`
- CLI/TUI command and visibility surfaces:
  - `mindbuddy/cli_commands.py`
  - `mindbuddy/tui/`
- runtime evaluation:
  - `mindbuddy/runtime_profile_eval.py`

The productization work should therefore build on existing surfaces instead of
starting a parallel subsystem. The design also needs to respect the lightweight
goal: local-first, transparent, inspectable, and suitable for a single developer
or a small team without introducing heavy cloud or enterprise control planes.

## Goals / Non-Goals

**Goals:**

- Make active instruction sources explicit and inspectable during a run and after
  the session is saved.
- Upgrade hooks from an internal event registry into a visible workflow surface
  with outcome summaries and operator controls.
- Turn background and delegated execution into bounded product features with
  clean context hygiene, replayable outputs, and inspectable failure reasons.
- Introduce a lightweight extension packaging model for local plugins/skills.
- Add release-ready evaluation and provider/outage diagnostics that explain real
  runtime quality, not just unit test health.

**Non-Goals:**

- Building a full enterprise policy server or SaaS fleet manager.
- Recreating the complete Claude Code marketplace or remote platform.
- Adding broad IDE integrations in this change.
- Replacing the existing runtime kernel with a new architecture.

## Decisions

### Decision 1: Treat P1-P3 as capability layers on top of the existing runtime

The change will extend the current runtime and session model rather than
introducing a second product stack. This keeps checkpoint/replay/runtime-trace
behavior canonical and avoids split-brain UX across CLI, TUI, and saved session
artifacts.

Alternatives considered:

- Build a separate "product shell" around the runtime.
  - Rejected because it would duplicate state and weaken recovery/replay.
- Defer productization until a multi-agent rewrite exists.
  - Rejected because the current kernel is already strong enough to support a
    lightweight product.

### Decision 2: Model instruction governance as explicit layers, not hidden prompt text

Instruction loading will be represented as structured layers with precedence and
origin metadata instead of remaining implicit prompt text. The same structured
view should feed turn-time inspection, session artifacts, and future debugging.

Alternatives considered:

context, status, and result contracts.

#### Scenario: Delegated task starts
- **WHEN** the main runtime launches background or subagent work
- **THEN** the delegated unit records its type, task description, start time,
  status, and context mode

#### Scenario: Delegated task uses isolated context
- **WHEN** the delegated unit is configured for isolated execution
- **THEN** only its final summary and durable artifacts flow back into the main
  session by default

### Requirement: Delegated status is inspectable while running and after completion
The product SHALL let users inspect delegated runtime units during execution and
after the session is saved.

#### Scenario: User checks live delegated status
- **WHEN** delegated work is running
- **THEN** the CLI or TUI shows active delegated units, status, and latest
  progress or result summary

#### Scenario: User replays a completed session
- **WHEN** a saved session contains delegated runtime activity
- **THEN** session replay includes delegated start, completion, failure, and
  retry summaries

### Requirement: Delegated failures are visible and recoverable
The product SHALL record delegated failure reasons and provide enough state to
retry or diagnose them without polluting the main context.

#### Scenario: Delegated unit fails
- **WHEN** delegated work errors, stalls, or is cancelled
- **THEN** the runtime records the failure reason and terminal status
- **AND** the saved session preserves that outcome for later inspection

#### Scenario: Delegated unit is retried
- **WHEN** the operator retries delegated work
- **THEN** the product distinguishes the retried run from the original run
- **AND** the replay surface can show both outcomes
